# Research Questions
---

1. Are there any points in time from which the number of terrorist attacks dramatically increase?
    - If there are, we want to find out exactly what was going on at this specific point in time to
      cause the large change, such as the beginning of a war or a period of poor national relations,
      or some other event. This question would look at longer intervals, such as years, unlike the
      intra-year trends of Question 4.
2. How have the types of attacks (bombings, assassinations, hijacking, etc.) changed over time?
    - With different conflicts and different periods in time, there seem to be types of attacks that
      are more common than others. We might even be able to see if a new kind of terrorist attack is
      beginning to happen more frequently.
3. What is the relationship between different regions and the number of attacks that happen there?
    - We know that regions like the Middle East tend to have a high number of terrorist attacks, but
      there could be other regions that have a lot of incidents that we generally donâ€™t hear about, or
      regions that have seen a rise in attacks in recent years.
4. Does the time of year have an effect on the number or type of attacks?
    - It would be very interesting if there appeared to be a correlation between this. Instead of
      the attacks being completely random, there might be times of the year where they happen more often.


## Dataset
---

The dataset that we are using is the Global Terrorism Database. It is provided by the University
of Maryland. The data for the events goes back from 1970 to the end of 2017, with 181,692 total
events. Each row is a single event that contains information about each event such as the time
(year, month, day), the place (region, country, state, city, specific location), the latitude and
longitude, a summary of the event, the attack type, and the targets. It also has the organization
or group that the attacker(s) belonged to, their motives, the weapons used, damage caused, and
the outcome, along with other information about the event. The dataset has all the information
we would need for our research questions, and plenty of other data if we decide or need to change
a question. The dataset also comes with a codebook that contains information on each individual
column in the table. It also comes with a geodatabase folder which contains all the shape files
necessary for creating a map for the dataset.
